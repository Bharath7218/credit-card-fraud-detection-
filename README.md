Fraud Detection in Credit Card Applications
Overview

This project focuses on detecting potential fraud in credit card applications using the Statlog (Australian Credit Approval) Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
.

The workflow combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for unsupervised anomaly detection with a supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify fraud probabilities.

Project Timeline

Sep'24 – Oct'24

Key Features

✅ Trained a Fraud Detection Model on the Australian Credit Approval dataset.

✅ Implemented the MiniSom library to train SOMs for better forecasting of anomalies.

✅ Used pylab to visualize fraud cases detected by SOMs.

✅ Combined SOM outputs with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

✅ Optimized with Binary Cross Entropy loss, achieving a loss of 0.2106.

Tech Stack

Python

MiniSom (Self-Organizing Maps)

Keras / TensorFlow (ANN)

Dataset

Source: Statlog (Australian Credit Approval) Dataset

Description: Contains credit card application records, including categorical and numerical features, used for fraud detection and approval classification tasks.

Results

Fraud probabilities estimated for each applicant.

Visual identification of anomalies via SOM heatmaps.

ANN classification accuracy improved with SOM pre-training.

Achieved loss = 0.2106.
